This service is an integral part of our offer and helps you reduce costs while we give valuable items a new life.",
    "section2Title": "Local specifics in every district",
    "section2Body": "Inner districts (1st–9th) require special logistics: no-parking zones must be registered 72 hours in advance, stairwells are often too narrow for large furniture, and neighbours are directly affected. We plan loading times precisely, liaise with property management in advance and ensure quiet transport via stairs. We have years of experience with complex household clearances in period flats.\n\nOuter districts (10th–23rd) offer more flexibility: car access, container spaces and more storage options. In districts like Floridsdorf, Liesing or Donaustadt, single-family and terraced houses are more common – here we can often drive directly to the property.",
    "section3Title": "Vienna legal framework & authorities",
    "section3Body": "MA 48 is responsible for waste disposal, but for larger clearances we work directly with certified disposal companies. For no-parking zones we organise all necessary permits: application, erection and collection of signs. Costs vary by zone and duration.\n\nFor period buildings we often coordinate with property management – especially for data reduction (GDPR-compliant document destruction) in offices or practice premises. We know Vienna house rules standards and adhere to them strictly.",
    "section4Title": "Travel times & logistics",
    "section4Body": "Our depots in Döbling and Liesing enable fast travel to all districts. Inner-city projects take 4–8 hours depending on size, larger apartment clearances a full day. In Neustadt and the city centre vehicles can only park at certain times – we factor this into planning.\n\nParking situation: Advance registration is essential especially in the 1st, 6th, 7th and 8th districts. In new-build areas like Seestadt Aspern or near Donau City there is better access.",
    "section5Title": "Pricing & specifics",
    "section5Body": "Vienna clearances benefit from short travel distances and well-coordinated teams. This has a positive effect on costs. Antiques from period flats are particularly valuable – we know the collector scene at Naschmarkt, flea markets and galleries.\n\nFor hoarder flats in Vienna we work closely with psychosocial services when requested. MA 48 supports in special hardship cases – we know the contacts and can help with applications. For hoarder clearances we use discreet unmarked teams.\n\nFor office and business clearances in the 1st district or city locations we coordinate closely with facility managers and have experience with business closures in high-rise floors.",
